									<h3>NGO | 2023</h3>
									<p>I played a pivotal role during my collaboration with NGOs, supporting a critical forthcoming grant initiative in Nigeria. My responsibilities included the collection, organization, and optimization of a massive dataset comprising two million entries. Leveraging advanced data structuring techniques and utilizing Pandas, I meticulously organized the dataset and eliminated duplicate entries, reducing it to 1,700,000 unique and submission-ready records. This effort streamlined the data preparation process, ensuring accuracy and integrity for the NGO's grant application, and contributing significantly to the project's overall efficiency and effectiveness. My work exemplified my commitment to precision, data management, and my ability to contribute to high-impact projects in a collaborative setting, underscoring my dedication to utilizing data-driven approaches to drive positive outcomes.</p>

							<h2>Skills</h2>
							<p>As an AWS certified cloud practitioner and a master of fun and seriousness, I thrive in the world of Python coding. Debugging, problem solving, and research are my superpowers, ensuring that I craft effective and scalable solutions with a touch of amusement. With a solid foundation in software development and an impressive command of Git, MySQL, and Linux, I navigate the coding landscape with ease.</p>
							<p>But it doesn't stop there—I have a wide range of interests that keep me balanced and inspired. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me grooving to the beats of music, kicking around a football, or diving into the thrilling realm of gaming. These passions fuel my creativity and allow me to approach projects from fresh perspectives.</p>
							<p>To add an extra spark to my repertoire, I've harnessed my current expertise in HTML, CSS, and the Flask framework. Armed with this knowledge, I embark on the journey of building dynamic and interactive online applications, bringing smiles to users' faces and leaving a lasting impression.</p>
							<p>Rest assured, I'm not just about fun and games—I'm a detail-oriented professional who takes pride in delivering high-quality code. Collaborative team settings are where I shine brightest, as I thrive on shared knowledge and the exhilaration of achieving common goals.</p>

							<h2>Done</h2>
							<p> I started my journey as a Python enthusiast, working on basic projects to build a strong programming foundation. My fascination with deep learning led me to the MIT Deep Learning course, where I gained expertise in AI and machine learning. Venturing into data science, I mastered Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights from complex datasets. During the AWS re/Start program, I discovered Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, which became the cornerstone of my backend engineering journey. This experience equipped me with the skills to create efficient and scalable web solutions. My journey highlights my commitment to continuous learning and adaptability. I'm now poised to apply my expertise as a backend Python engineer, ready to contribute to your projects.
								Thank you for visiting my resume website, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.</p>
